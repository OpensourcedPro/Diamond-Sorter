Katana-ds (ds for dork_scanner) is a simple python tool that automates Google Hacking/Dorking and supports Tor.
It becomes a more powerful in combination with [GHDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)

**Note 25/09/2021** : This Repo is New but the script it self is old back when google dorking was something, i wrote this script back in Highschool during the process of learning how to scrap using python and in order to get to use on bs4 and other Python Packages and i learned alot of things along, still there's alot of people who use this script... Thanks for 500 ⭐

Tor mode gives you 1 input which is the search query but before you should have tor proxy running on port 9050 this time there is no IP blocking the script search in 3 tor search engines Phobos, Tor66 and Tordex (more will be added)

## What if :

- The script print 'HTTP Error 429 too many requests' :
**change the TLD**
- The script print 'urllib.error.URLError Errno 1104' :
**check if the TLD is true**
- Changing the TLD doesn't work : (2 solutions)
**1-change your ip by disconnecting and reconnecting again or use a good vpn**
**2-Delete the .google-cookie file in Katana Directory**
- Tor mode show 'Failed to establish a new connection' :
**make sure that tor proxy up and running on port 9050**

## Proxy Mode : (supported by python 3.7 only)

Proxy mode find proxy servers and print them it will print 100 Different Proxy server Each time
